# Massive MIMO NOMA with wavelet pulse shaping to minimize undesired channel interference

Wavelet Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) combined with a massive MIMO system for a 6G network 
is anticipated in this study. For mMIMO transmissions, the suggested system could enhance performance by utilizing wavelets and can compensate 
for channel impairments for the transmitted signal. Performance measures include spectral efficiency (SE), symbol error rate (SER), and peak-to-average power 
ratio (PAPR). Simulation results prove that the proposed system outperforms the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) based NOMA systems.
