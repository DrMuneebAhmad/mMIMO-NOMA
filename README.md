# Massive MIMO NOMA with wavelet pulse shaping to minimize undesired channel interference

Wavelet Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) combined with massive MIMO system for 6G network 
is acticipated in this study. For mMIMO transmissions, the suggested system could enhance the performance by utilizing wavelets and is able to compensate 
channel impairments for the transmitted signal. Performance measures include spectral efficiency (SE), symbol error rate (SER), and peak to average power 
ratio (PAPR). Simulation results prove that the proposed system outperforms the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) based NOMA systems.
